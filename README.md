<p align="justify">In this study, we employed human embryoid body as an in vitro model to mimic early development and conducted single-cell ATAC sequencing to delineate lineage-specific chromatin regulatory elements and their associated transcription factor (TF) networks. </p>

# Consistency score
In this study, we have introduced "consistency score" to assist cell clustering, which took into account both promotor and TF motif accessbility.
